## Wins and Loses 

I think being able to utilize class to class interaction and create a functioning peiece of code was a big win. Writting the Tests for the classes and methods was difficult due to this being the first time attempting to write tests. However, I am happy I got the exposure to TDD and played with hooks in the beginnig of my tests to write more dry code!
